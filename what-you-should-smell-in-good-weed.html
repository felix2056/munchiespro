<p dir="ltr">Any terpenes definition you find online is likely to mention one thing first and foremost: it's the terpenes in weed that are responsible for the smell. <a href="what-are-cannabis-terpenes-and-what-do-they-do.html" target="_blank">Terpenes</a>, also known as terpenoids (or terps for short), are oils secreted from the trichomes of cannabis flower. <a href="https://wheresweed.com/blog/education/2019/sep/what-are-trichomes-and-what-do-they-do" target="_blank">Trichomes are small crystalline glands</a> that grow out of cannabis flower to protect the plant from natural predators. Terpenes are also a natural defense mechanism, meant to repel unwanted predators but also attract insects that will help the pollination process. All of this is great, but what are terps good for other than smell? Do they contribute to the flavor of weed? Yes. They are responsible for most of the flavors in cannabis, and they also offer a variety of medicinal benefits. Terpenes do a lot of heavy lifting for cannabis, although it's important to note that they are not only found in cannabis. In fact, terpenes are found in nearly every plant.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Types of Terpenes Benefits &amp; Aromas</h3>
<p dir="ltr">There are many types of terpenes, all of which offer unique benefits. Here's a quick list of terpenes, their associated aromas, and their benefits:</p>
<ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><a href="https://wheresweed.com/blog/education/2020/oct/what-is-myrcene-the-abundant-terpene-in-marijuana" target="_blank">Myrcene</a>: smells of musky herbs and citrus (Ever wonder "why does weed smell like skunk?"

<p dir="ltr">Just like how not all marijuana smells the same, not every strain contains the same terpenes. And of course, while terpenes are inextricably important to the flavor and smell of weed, they aren't the only thing that can help you decide the good bud from the bad.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What Does Marijuana Smell Like?</h2><figure class="blog_right"><img width="800" height="800" class="lazy-load" data-cfsrc="/blog_images/8x8/what-you-should-smell-in-good-weed-2.png" data-image="1" style="display:none;visibility:hidden;"><noscript><img width=800 height=800 class="lazy-load" src="/blog_images/8x8/what-you-should-smell-in-good-weed-2.png" data-image="1"></noscript><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/73ITGKJkBcc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Unsplash</a></figure>
<p dir="ltr">Let's take a look at three stages in the cannabis lifecycle: growing weed, cured weed, and smoked weed. At each point in its life, your cannabis is going to smell just a little different.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">The Smell of Cannabis While Growing</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The only time cannabis doesn't smell is at the very beginning. This quickly changes, though. After roughly 3-6 weeks, cannabis plants begin to produce a distinct odor. It reaches full potency when it flowers (cannabis flower produces most of the plant's aromas). During this early stage, cannabis should smell a little musty and piney - more earthy than a strain might be once it is cured.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">The Smell of Cannabis After Being Cured</h3>
<p dir="ltr">During the curing process, cannabis will likely smell more grassy. This hay smell usually sticks around for roughly the first 7-10 days of drying. However, after the curing process, cannabis should return to its more natural smell. A health bud's smell will be dictated by how it is stored and the terpenes it contains. Weed, compared to other dried plants, has a much stronger smell. Cannabis stored in properly sealed, dry containers, can smell floral, citrusy, piney, candied, sweet like vanilla, earthy, grassy, skunky, and anywhere in between these flavor profiles. We'll get into what cannabis smells like if it isn't correctly stored in the next section.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">The Smell of Cannabis While Smoked</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Smoked cannabis is going to intensify its natural flavors and distribute them as far as the smoke carries. It will also, naturally, smell like smoke. If you properly grind your cannabis and apply the correct amount of heat, your weed shouldn't smell too burnt. However, it's easy to overheat your cannabis, which results in a charred, burnt, bitter smell that also translates into the flavor.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What Does Pot Smell Like That's Bad?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">There are two types of "bad" cannabis we're going to discuss today: poor quality weed and unsafe weed. Poor quality weed is either going to be very old or poorly cultivated, meaning its primarily leaves and stems. Over time, marijuana will lose its potent smell (along with its potent psychoactive effects). Old marijuana will look brown and dried up,&nbsp; it will smell far less intense than fresh healthy cannabis and might even smell like the container it's stored in (especially if not properly stored). The same goes for cannabis that's primarily leaves and stems. The flower is where the cannabis smell is strongest. If you don't smell much when you take a sniff at the dispensary, you probably want to steer clear.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The other, much worse type of <a href="https://wheresweed.com/blog/health/2021/feb/is-moldy-weed-bad-for-you" target="_blank">bad weed is moldy</a> or improperly cured weed. Cannabis that has been improperly cured or stored can easily begin to grow mold. Mold, when consumed, can be incredibly harmful to your health. A tell-tale sign that weed is moldy (or well on its way) is the smell. Moldy cannabis will smell mustier, almost like mildew. Another smell to watch out for is potent chemical, acrid aromas. This could be an indicator that the weed was grown with improper pesticide use. If you want good weed, stick to the stuff that smells fresh and potent (refer to the aromas above for an ideal list).&nbsp;</p>

And of course, while terpenes are inextricably important to the flavor and smell of weed, they aren't the only thing that can help you decide the good bud from the bad.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2 dir=\"ltr\"\u003EWhat Does Marijuana Smell Like?\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cfigure class=\"blog_right\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fblog_images\u002Ffull\u002Fwhat-you-should-smell-in-good-weed-2.png\" data-image=\"1\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002F73ITGKJkBcc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EUnsplash\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\r\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ELet's take a look at three stages in the cannabis lifecycle: growing weed, cured weed, and smoked weed.

This quickly changes, though. After roughly 3-6 weeks, cannabis plants begin to produce a distinct odor. It reaches full potency when it flowers (cannabis flower produces most of the plant's aromas). During this early stage, cannabis should smell a little musty and piney - more earthy than a strain might be once it is cured.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003EThe Smell of Cannabis After Being Cured\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EDuring the curing process, cannabis will likely smell more grassy. This hay smell usually sticks around for roughly the first 7-10 days of drying. However, after the curing process, cannabis should return to its more natural smell. A health bud's smell will be dictated by how it is stored and the terpenes it contains. Weed, compared to other dried plants, has a much stronger smell. Cannabis stored in properly sealed, dry containers, can smell floral, citrusy, piney, candied, sweet like vanilla, earthy, grassy, skunky, and anywhere in between these flavor profiles. We'll get into what cannabis smells like if it isn't correctly stored in the next section.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003EThe Smell of Cannabis While Smoked\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ESmoked cannabis is going to intensify its natural flavors and distribute them as far as the smoke carries. It will also, naturally, smell like smoke. If you properly grind your cannabis and apply the correct amount of heat, your weed shouldn't smell too burnt. However, it's easy to overheat your cannabis, which results in a charred, burnt, bitter smell that also translates into the flavor.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2 dir=\"ltr\"\u003EWhat Does Pot Smell Like That's Bad?\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EThere are two types of \"bad\" cannabis we're going to discuss today: poor quality weed and unsafe weed. Poor quality weed is either going to be very old or poorly cultivated, meaning its primarily leaves and stems. Over time, marijuana will lose its potent smell (along with its potent psychoactive effects). Old marijuana will look brown and dried up,&nbsp; it will smell far less intense than fresh healthy cannabis and might even smell like the container it's stored in (especially if not properly stored). The same goes for cannabis that's primarily leaves and stems. The flower is where the cannabis smell is strongest.

Cannabis that has been improperly cured or stored can easily begin to grow mold. Mold, when consumed, can be incredibly harmful to your health. A tell-tale sign that weed is moldy (or well on its way) is the smell. Moldy cannabis will smell mustier, almost like mildew. Another smell to watch out for is potent chemical, acrid aromas. This could be an indicator that the weed was grown with improper pesticide use.
