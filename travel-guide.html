										Georgetown
									</a></h3> <!----></div> <p class="mb-3 text-left"></p><p>One of the District’s most impressive DC landmarks is the charming, historical district of Georgetown. Here, you’ll find streets lined with cobblestones, historic homes from the late 1700’s, and gorgeous Romanesque architecture. Because it’s home to Georgetown University, this area is alive with the energy of its students. You’ll feel the vibe as you kayak down the Potomac or enjoy a run at along its waterfront park. Shopping is a great form of exercise, and Georgetown is a shopping mecca. You’ll easily get your daily 10,000 steps in one trip! When you need a break, enjoy a drink at one of the many historic pubs. With over 100 restaurants, you’re sure to find the perfect lunch on a quaint outdoor patio, or a gourmet dinner at a Michelin-rated restaurant. With so many things to do, Georgetown is a perfect day trip!</p><p></p></div><div id="where-to-visit/the-national-mall" class="w-full observe"><img data-cfsrc="/guide_images/full/the-national-mall-1.jpg" height="551" width="551" alt="The National Mall" class="w-full" style="display:none;visibility:hidden;"><noscript><img src="/guide_images/full/the-national-mall-1.jpg" height="551" width="551" alt="The National Mall" class="w-full"></noscript> <p class="mb-3 text-left">

									</a></h3> <!----></div> <p class="mb-3 text-left"></p><p>Who can think of Washington DC without the National Mall coming to mind! This long grassy area is anchored at the eastern end by the U.S. Capitol Building and the western end by the elegant Lincoln Memorial. The Washington Monument is majestically placed in the middle. The National Mall is America’s most-visited national park where you’ll find locals and visitors meandering past our nation’s most iconic memorials, which honor American heroes whose lives were sacrificed in the name of freedom. The Mall is flanked by <a href="https://www.si.edu/museums">Smithsonian museums</a>, while the White House is just to the north, and the United States Supreme Court is to the East. When visiting the National Mall, be sure to bring your walking shoes to fully enjoy the many jogging paths, picnic areas, food trucks, ice cream stands and even a carousel.</p><p></p></div><div id="where-to-visit/old-town-alexandria" class="w-full observe"><img data-cfsrc="/guide_images/full/old-town-alexandria-1.jpg" height="551" width="551" alt="Old Town Alexandria" class="w-full" style="display:none;visibility:hidden;"><noscript><img src="/guide_images/full/old-town-alexandria-1.jpg" height="551" width="551" alt="Old Town Alexandria" class="w-full"></noscript> <p class="mb-3 text-left">

										Old Town Alexandria
									</a></h3> <!----></div> <p class="mb-3 text-left"></p><p>Just a few miles outside of Washington DC, Old Town Alexandria, Virginia is like stepping back in time. Alexandria is known as George Washington’s hometown, while Mt. Vernon, his family’s estate, is also well worth a visit! Before the Civil War, Alexandria was one of the largest slave-trading ports. Today, it is a charming town with lots of historic sites. Many of the picturesque colonial row houses still have front-door lights fueled with gas and the sidewalks are made exclusively with red brick. Alexandria has a wonderful waterfront on the Potomac to explore, where you’ll find King Street, the city’s main street, filled with independent stores, speakeasies, bars and a vibrant dining scene. Have fun on a river cruise or touring historic Gadsby’s Tavern, where George Washington held his inaugural ball. Just leave time to see America’s skinniest historic house (seven feet wide!), experience the oldest farmer’s market in America and spend the evening on an ever-popular ghost tour!</p><p></p></div></div><div><h2 id="what-to-do" class="pt-2 mb-3 text-2xl text-left observe">

Just ten minutes from Washington DC (on the Maryland side of the Potomac River) is the National Harbor – an all-in-one family destination offering lots of fun things to do. The small sandy beach includes a gigantic famous sculpture, “The Awakening” that stretches the entire length of the beach. For sunset, take a ride on the Capital Wheel, an observation/ferris wheel that will sweep you up 180 feet for unparalleled views of Maryland, Virginia and Washington DC! The Harbor also has dining boat cruises and tours, kayak and paddle boat rentals. The vibrant Waterfront District offers more than 75 boutique shops and a wide selection of restaurants. We recommend <a href="https://www.nationalharbor.com/dining/brother-jimmys/">Brother Jimmy’s BBQ</a>, an authentic taste of the South in chilled-out surroundings.</p>
<p>Attention adults! You may want to spend the night in the area because the MGM National Harbor is a luxury casino resort with high-end retail, renowned chef-driven restaurants, a 3,000-seat theater and the largest gaming floor outside of Las Vegas is located just minutes away.

But grandeur and awesomeness aside, DC locals and visitors alike know the city as a hotspot for entertainment, restaurants, architecture, taverns, green spaces, and an amazing art scene. It’s home to world-renowned museums of art, science and culture – and most of them are free of charge! Walk downtown where the architecture of the grand federal buildings ranges from baroque to classical, to modern. Stroll quaint neighborhoods of colonial row houses lined with trees or tour the mansions from the 1800s that are now embassies for countries around the globe. Visiting in late March?

In 2015, Initiative 71 (or the Legalization of Possession of Minimal Amounts of Marijuana for Personal Use Act) went into effect, legalizing medical and recreational weed possession in DC. Although there are a small handful of medical marijuana dispensaries that service over 6,000 patients in the area, I71 never included provisions for recreational dispensaries to open. While people over the age of 21 may have up to 2 ounces of marijuana, it is still illegal to sell marijuana recreationally. For recreational consumers, this makes it complicated to even obtain bud and leaves a very grey area for other businesses to operate. Specifically speaking, many DC delivery businesses exist who utilize the legal act of \"gifting\" cannabis to get the product to the people. Consumers will often have to buy a t-shirt, sticker or snack food for a high price to receive an amount of weed as a “gift” alongside the original purchase.

Alexandria is known as George Washington’s hometown, while Mt. Vernon, his family’s estate, is also well worth a visit! Before the Civil War, Alexandria was one of the largest slave-trading ports. Today, it is a charming town with lots of historic sites. Many of the picturesque colonial row houses still have front-door lights fueled with gas and the sidewalks are made exclusively with red brick. Alexandria has a wonderful waterfront on the Potomac to explore, where you’ll find King Street, the city’s main street, filled with independent stores, speakeasies, bars and a vibrant dining scene. Have fun on a river cruise or touring historic Gadsby’s Tavern, where George Washington held his inaugural ball.
